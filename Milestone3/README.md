# 📖 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Freight Quote Generation System (IFQGS)** is an AI-powered logistics assistant designed to simplify freight quotation, shipment analysis, and logistics decision-making through the integration of **Machine Learning**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

The project was developed in **three progressive milestones**. The first milestone focuses on secure user authentication, the second milestone introduces AI-powered freight analysis using machine learning models and an intelligent LLM assistant, and the third milestone integrates a **RAG pipeline** that enables the system to answer logistics-related queries using information retrieved from a custom knowledge base instead of relying solely on the language model.

The system is deployed using **Google Colab**, **Streamlit**, and **Ngrok**, allowing users to securely access the application through a web browser without requiring local installation.

# ✅ Milestone 1 Features

### 🔐 Secure User Authentication
Provides a complete Login, Signup, Forgot Password, and Logout system with secure session management using JWT tokens.

### 📧 Email OTP Verification
Verifies user identity by sending a One-Time Password (OTP) through Gmail SMTP during registration and password reset.

### 🔑 JWT Authentication
Uses JSON Web Tokens to securely manage authenticated sessions and protect user access.

### 🔒 Password Encryption
Stores passwords securely using BCrypt hashing instead of plain text.

### ❓ Security Questions
Allows users to reset passwords using predefined security questions as an additional authentication layer.

### 💾 SQLite Database
Stores user information, credentials, and authentication data locally using SQLite.

### 🌐 Streamlit Web Interface
Provides a clean and responsive user interface accessible directly from the browser.

### 🌍 Public Deployment using Ngrok
Exposes the Streamlit application running on Google Colab to the internet using Ngrok.

Enhances the LLM by retrieving relevant information from a custom logistics knowledge base before generating responses.

### 📄 PDF Knowledge Base
Indexes logistics manuals, freight documents, shipping guidelines, and company documents for intelligent retrieval.

### 🔎 Semantic Search
Uses sentence embeddings and vector similarity search to identify the most relevant document chunks.

### 🧠 Context-Aware Response Generation
Combines retrieved document context with the LLM to produce accurate, grounded, and relevant answers.

### 📦 FAISS Vector Database
Stores vector embeddings for efficient similarity search across large document collections.

### 📑 Automatic Document Chunking
Splits large PDF documents into smaller text chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

### 💬 Intelligent Logistics Assistant
Answers logistics-related queries using both retrieved knowledge and the reasoning capabilities of the LLM.

### 🎯 Reduced Hallucinations
Minimizes incorrect or fabricated responses by grounding answers in trusted documents.

## 📖 RAG Architecture Explanation

1. Logistics PDF documents are uploaded into the system.
2. Documents are divided into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
3. Sentence embeddings are generated for each text chunk.
4. The embeddings are stored inside a **FAISS Vector Database**.
5. User queries are converted into vector embeddings using the same embedding model.
6. FAISS performs similarity search to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
7. The retrieved context is combined with the user's query.
8. The **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** Large Language Model generates an accurate, context-aware response.
